## Quick data setup:

The simulation will run without manually downloading data, but it will ping yahoo many times.
This can be avoided by downloading the data, or by downloading the data cache.

Static data is taken directly from Nasdaq: http://www.nasdaq.com/screening/company-list.aspx

Data may be found at: https://gist.github.com/michaelrauh/9cebbc1c7cca188c0224

Top level cache (this lives in the data folder) is here for convenience: https://www.dropbox.com/s/axxccop3b9yc7o2/whole_market2015930200501.p?dl=0

## Running the Simulation
python3 main.py

## Previous version
Previous versions of the program do not have the same interface as the current version. Some of the previous versions are built on python 2.7. Some of them access web addresses which do not exist.
